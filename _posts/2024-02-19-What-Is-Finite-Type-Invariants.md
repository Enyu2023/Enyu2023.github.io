# Introduction

In some sense, finite type invariants are "polynomials" over the linear span of all knots. One way to define a polynomial of degree $n$ over a field $\mathbb R$ is to say its $n$-th derivative identically vanishes, and if we are working with something not so "continous", we need to generalize our concept of derivatives. For example, over $\mathbb Z$ this just becomes difference, namely if we have a sequence $a_n$, then it's first derivative is just $b_n=a_n-a_{n+1}$. What about over  $\mathbb R^k$? Then we must develop the idea of "partial derivatives", namely if $f(x_1,\cdots, x_k)$ is a multivariable function, then we say it's a polynomial if all its $n$-th partial derivatives vanish. 

Now we want to generalize this notation to something much more complicated: the space spaned by all knots $\mathcal K$. How to define derivatives over this messy space? We first need to figure out what is 




Well, there is yet another way to define a derivative: algebraicly we are looking for an operater on $\mathcal K^*$ so that it satisfies Leibniz rule.
